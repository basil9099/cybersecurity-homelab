# Nmap Scan

This scenario demonstrates how an attacker performs network reconnaissance using Nmap. Capture the traffic with Wireshark and look for patterns such as TCP SYN scans or service probes.

## Steps
1. Run `nmap -sS <target>` from the attacker machine.
2. Monitor the network with Wireshark.
3. Review the packets to identify scan characteristics.
