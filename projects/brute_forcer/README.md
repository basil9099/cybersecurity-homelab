# üîê DVWA Brute-Force Automation Script

This Python script performs a dictionary-based brute-force attack on the **Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)** login form. It targets the login page hosted locally (`http://localhost/dvwa/login.php`), demonstrating a low-security brute-force exploitation.

> ‚úÖ Tested and working successfully against DVWA on **Kali Linux**.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Dynamically pulls CSRF token from each login attempt
- Uses `requests.Session()` to handle cookies automatically
- Clean output with successful and failed attempts
- Pauses gracefully on errors or keyboard interrupts

---

## üì∏ Screenshots

> These demonstrate the attack sequence and successful credential discovery.

## üß™ How to Test

1. **Ensure DVWA is running** on `http://localhost/dvwa/login.php`
    - Security Level: **Low**
    - Username: `gordonb`
    - Password: Include something like `abc123` or `password` in the wordlist for successful testing

2. **Set up environment**:
    ```bash
    sudo service apache2 start
    sudo service mysql start
    ```

3. **Run the script**:
    ```bash
    python3 brute.py
    ```

4. **Observe results**:
    - ‚ùå Failed attempts are clearly logged
    - ‚úÖ Successful password crack is printed with line number

## üß† Learning Objective

This script was created to help understand:

- CSRF token handling during automated login attempts
- Working with Python's `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`
- Brute-force logic and defensive mitigation strategies
- Practical exploitation using DVWA in a safe lab environment
