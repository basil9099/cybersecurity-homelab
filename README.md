# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Homelab Documentation

Welcome to my cybersecurity homelab! This repo contains real-world labs and exercises that demonstrate my hands-on skills in offensive security, penetration testing, and vulnerability assessments.

##  What’s Inside
- Exploits: Metasploit, manual RCE, reverse shells
- Enumeration: SMB, LDAP, DNS, and Web recon
- Privilege Escalation: Linux and Windows
- Web Application Attacks: SQLi, XSS, IDOR
- Tools Used: Nmap, Burp Suite, Wireshark, Nikto, SQLMap, etc.

## 🛡️ Defensive Security Labs

This section focuses on defensive cybersecurity practices to complement offensive testing. It includes tools and environments for:

- **Network Monitoring**: Analyze traffic with Wireshark, Zeek, and Suricata.
- **Endpoint Protection**: Deploy and configure EDR/AV solutions.
- **SIEM Setup**: Install and configure Security Onion, Wazuh, or ELK.
- **Threat Hunting**: Use Sigma rules, Sysmon, and HELK for detection.

Each subfolder contains setup guides, configuration files, and example labs.

## Screenshots & Evidence
All critical steps include screenshots or terminal output.

## Structure
See folders by category. Each has its own detailed markdown write-up.

## Goal
To showcase offensive and defensive security skills in a structured, reproducible format.
