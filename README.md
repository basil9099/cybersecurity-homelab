# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Homelab

Welcome to my personal cybersecurity homelab — a practical, hands-on space where I simulate real-world attacks, build detection pipelines, and automate analysis to sharpen my offensive and defensive security skills.

> ⚠️ **Work in Progress**: I'm using this repository as a personal training ground to build technical cybersecurity skills, with the hope of transitioning into a professional security role. Feedback, learning suggestions, and collaborations are always welcome!
