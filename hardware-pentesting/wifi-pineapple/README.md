- [wifi-pineapple-cloner GitHub Repository](https://github.com/xchwarze/wifi-pineapple-cloner)

## üìå Overview

The WiFi Pineapple is a device used for wireless network auditing and penetration testing.  
I built this device using the GL.iNet MT300N v2 (Mango) router flashed with a Pineapple clone image based on OpenWRT.

**Features:**
- Rogue access point creation
- Packet sniffing and logging
- Credential harvesting
- Modular payloads via web interface
