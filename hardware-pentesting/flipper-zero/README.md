# 🧿 Flipper Zero Labs

## Overview
This section documents my experiments and usage of the Flipper Zero device for security testing, signal analysis, and hardware hacking. These labs are informal and are not meant to be exhaustive or instructional — just a way to track learning and experiments.

## Capabilities Explored
- 🔓 RFID/NFC cloning (MiFare, HID)
- 📻 Sub-GHz signal capture and replay (garage doors, intercoms, etc.)
- 📡 Infrared signal testing and fuzzing
- 🔋 BadUSB payloads for simple device interaction
- 🧠 Exploring Bluetooth LE interactions
- 📷 Signal sniffing using GPIO and iButton features

## Tools and Firmware
- Flipper Zero Firmware: [Unleashed Firmware](https://github.com/Flipper-XFW/Flipper-XFW.github.io)
- Companion Apps:
  - qFlipper
  - Flipper Mobile App (for BLE-based file transfer)
- External Repos:
  - Flipper-Toolkit
  - SubGHz signal databases

## Notes
Experiments are conducted in a **controlled, lawful environment**. Always ensure you have permission before interacting with any real-world device or system.

> “Think of the Flipper as a multitool for exploring and understanding how physical access and signal-based systems work.”
